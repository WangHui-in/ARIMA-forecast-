## U.S. Natural Disaster Forecasting Project
This repository is dedicated to developing a predictive model for U.S. natural disasters using historical disaster declaration data. The Python script in this repository, named DisasterForecast.py, applies advanced statistical and machine learning methods to forecast the likelihood and potential severity of future natural disasters in the United States.

## Data Source
The dataset utilized for this forecasting project is sourced from Kaggle and includes comprehensive records of U.S. natural disaster declarations. You can access the dataset here.

## Project Purpose
Disaster Prediction: Use historical data to model and predict future natural disasters in the U.S.
Risk Management: Assist governmental and non-governmental organizations in planning and resource allocation for disaster management.
Analytical Skills Demonstration: Exhibit the application of data science techniques in the field of disaster risk reduction.

## Code Description
The DisasterForecast.py script employs a combination of data analysis and predictive modeling techniques tailored to understand and forecast natural disaster trends. Hereâ€™s what the script includes:

1. Data Preparation:

Import and clean data from the disaster declarations dataset.
Prepare the data for analysis by selecting relevant features and handling missing values.

2. Predictive Modeling:

Implement statistical or machine learning models such as time series forecasting or regression analysis.
Validate and tune the models to achieve reliable predictions.

3. Forecast Generation:

Use the trained models to forecast future disaster events.
Provide probability assessments and potential impact analyses.

## Features
Trend Analysis: Examine historical data to identify trends in disaster occurrences.
Model Development: Develop and tune predictive models to estimate future risks.
Visualization: Generate visual outputs to illustrate the results of data analysis and predictions.

## Usage
This script is crucial for analysts, researchers, and policymakers engaged in disaster management and planning. It can be adapted to different geographical data sets or expanded to include various types of natural disasters.

## File Structure
DisasterForecast.py: The primary Python script for disaster data analysis and prediction.
